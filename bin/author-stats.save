# Usage: author-stats [scope-qualifiers]
#
# <scope-qualifiers> are any valid arguments usable with 'git log' to restrict
# the set of commits to analyze.  Some common ones are:
# v3.4..  - set a baseline version (only include commits after v3.4)
# --author="*sony*"
#
# uses environment var GIT_SCOPE, if defined
