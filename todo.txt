To do list for upstream-analysis-tools:

 - run some basic tests to revalidate the workflow
   - especially after modifying some of the scripts
 - create add-to-area tool
 - increase automation
1   - make tool to download source from major repositories, and isolate
	kernel code
      - make a wiki page with repository list
   - automatically create base.diff
     - parse base kernel version from Makefile
     - if in git repository, do e.g. 'git diff v3.4.. >base.diff'
     - if not in git repository, download kernel, untar it and make diff
   - check for weird dirs and links (e.g. mediatek and intel) and 
     change them to something standardized
   - do automatic dos2unix, if needed
 - make output be in CSV format, for direct input into spreadsheets

 - create tag system to put code into more than one bucket
 - divide code into smaller pieces (sub-areas)
 - determine 'origin' of code (e.g. Google, Soc Vendor, Upstream, other)
   - use tags to indicate origin for different code areas
   - find code already upstream

== features ==
have git tools support a GIT_SCOPE environment variable

== rejected features ==
 - use '#!/usr/bin/env python2.7' for shebang line
   - rejected for diffinfo of '-u' argument in diffinfo, which #!/usr/bin/env
     doesn't support (Linux only passes one argument to a shebang line)

== done ==
 + publish tools (will be in white paper for LCJ)
