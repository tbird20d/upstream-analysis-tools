# upstream-analysis-tools

This project consists of a set of tools for analysing the status of
software relative to it's upstream open-source project.  This project is
initially focused on the Linux kernel.

The tools allow you to compare a Linux kernel source tree with it's
upstream (mainline) source, and gather various statistics and
information about it.  It is intended to allow individuals and companies
to assess the status of a particular source tree, by seeing how much code
is out-of-tree, and where that code is concentrated.

These tools were originally written by Tim Bird, at Sony and Sony
Mobile, for analysing internal source trees, and also for work in the
Device Mainlining project of the CEWG of the Linux Foundation.

# INSTALLATION
To install the tools, copy them to your favorite 'bin' directory, or
add the 'bin' directory in this distribution to your path.

See the Documentation.txt file for information about the individual tools
and their use.
